= Ruby FileMagic Library Binding

== Summary

ruby-filemagic provides a ruby binding to GNU libmagic.


== Prerequisites

GNU file package to provide libmagic (tested with 5.04).  On
Debian-like Linux systems this is provided by package libmagic-dev.
For Solaris systems sunfreeware.com provides package SMCfile.


== Build and install

To build either:

    rake build

or run:

    ruby extconf.rb
    make

To install (non-gem) either:

    rake install

or run:

    make install


== Gem

To create a gem, build as above then either:

    rake gem

or run:

    gem build ruby-filemagic.gemspec


== Tests

Note that tests may fail if you have a different version of libmagic
since the file content descriptive text may vary slightly. For example,
a plain file gives these differing results:

  libmagic v5.04: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
  libmagic v4.26: text/plain charset=us-ascii

To run the unit tests:

    rake test

or run:

    ruby test/regress.rb


== Examples

    require 'filemagic'
    magic = FileMagic.new
    puts magic.file('/tmp/foo')
    magic.close


== Copying

The filemagic extension library is copywrited free software by Travis
Whitton <whitton@atlantic.net>. You can redistribute it under the terms
specified in the COPYING file of the Ruby distribution.
