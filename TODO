= Ruby FileMagic Library Binding

== TODO

* Find a better way to handle magic_load than just defaulting to NULL
* Find a way to make magic_check work on NULL
* Find a way to make magic_setflags work
* Refactor code into initialize instead of new
* Enable blocks for automatic cleanup:

    FileMagic.open("somefile.txt") do |file|
      # close is called at the end of this block
    end
